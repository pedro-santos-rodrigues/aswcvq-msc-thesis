\chapter{Background}
\label{cha:background}
After the presentation of the problem and the motivations behind it, in this chapter will be introduced key concepts of Human-Computer Interaction, as well as, a briefly contextualization of the OutSystems Platform Background that are indispensable for the comprehension and progression of this study.

\section{Human-Computer Interaction}
\label{sec:human_computer_interaction}
Since the goal of this project is to improve and extend the visual language that gives to the user the possibility to construct queries through manipulation of visual components on the graphical user interface. as much as possible, instead of textual languages, human-computer interaction concepts, rules and techniques are fundamental to design and evaluate any possible solution to this problem. Thus, following will be presented a summary of human-computer interaction topics taken into account throughout the design and development of this project.

Although computer systems have been designed by humans, these two vertices of human-computer interaction do not communicate through the same language. Nonetheless, these type of systems were created to support, in a transparent way, human’s tasks and requirements, forgiving careless mistakes. Thus, human-computer interaction fields aim to study the relationship of users and computer systems, in the context of the users’ desired tasks, in order to “unfold and reveal challenges and insights, and to instrument appropriate solutions for alleviating the current obstacles to the access and use of advanced information technologies” \cite{userInterfacesForAll_newPerspectivesIntoHumanComputerInteraction}. 

%\textit{Dix et al.} \cite{humanComputerInteraction} reinforce this too, saying that “HCI involves the design, implementation and evaluation of interactive systems in the context of the user’s task and work”.

\subsection{Interaction Models}
\label{subsec:interaction_models}

Therefore, have been proposed interaction models to represent the intention of a user to perform a certain task on a system. One of the most influential is Norman’s model, that characterize the interaction of a user with a system beyond execution-evaluation cycles. \cite{humanComputerInteraction} Thereby, the execution is the flow when the user interacts with the system, and the evaluation phase comprise the presentation and the interpretation of the system output. However, this model only represents the interaction from the users’ point of view. Thereupon, Abowd and Beale \cite{userSystemsAndInterfaces_aUnifyingFrameworkForInteraction} proposed an extension of this model where it is possible to view how the system communicates through the interface.

In this approach, represented in \ref{fig:abowdAndBealeModel}, after the user has defined his goal and respective tasks to achieve it, he transmits their intention (articulation) through input language, and after this, that information is translated to system language (performance), ending the execution phase. Secondly, the result of the action executed by the system is presented (presentation) and the user observes it (observation), ending the evaluation phase.

These models are useful to understand two concepts that are important to not forget when anyone designs a system, since these are two effects that designers want to reduce as much as possible in order to optimize the effectiveness of the human-computer dialogue. Following, them will be described respecting \textit{Dix et al.} \cite{humanComputerInteraction} definition:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gulf of execution}: “Difference between the user’s formulation of the actions to reach the goal and the actions allowed by the system. If the actions allowed by the system correspond to those intended by the user, the interaction will be effective.”
    \item \textbf{Gulfs of evaluation}: “Distance between the physical representation of the system state and the expectation of the user. If the user can readily evaluate the presentation in terms of his goal, the gulf of evaluation is small.”
\end{itemize}
