\chapter{Proposed Solution}
\label{cha:proposed_solution}
This chapter presents the solution proposed to the problems presented, that includes a description of the process realized to understand why the people use SQL to made queries instead of Aggregates, such as Personal Interviews and a Quantitative Analysis of the queries which customers ran on the cloud. Furthermore, this chapter presents what is the scope of the project, so it will be explained what problems will be tacked in detail.

\section{Requirements Analysis}
\label{sec:requirements_analysis}
\textcolor{gray}{As referred above, this section presents the results of the analysis made to understand why developers use SQL to make queries instead of Aggregates through its Visual Querying Features.}

\section{Scope Definition}
\label{sec:scope_definition}
\textcolor{gray}{In this section, will be presented what were the decisions made of which problems will be addressed in this thesis, once the initial problem presentation had a wide scope and it was concluded that it's not possible to resolve all the Aggregates expressiveness and experience problems in this project.}

\section{Proposed Implementation}
\label{sec:proposed_implementation}
\textcolor{gray}{Following, will be detailed the intended project, indicating all the problems identified and all the approached that will be adopted.}
