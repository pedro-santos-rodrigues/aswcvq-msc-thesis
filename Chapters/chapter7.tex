    I think that I would like to use this system frequently.                                   & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}3.34                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}4.33                                         & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}0.99                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}0.54                                          \\ \midrule
    I found the system unnecessarily complex.                                                  & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}2.88                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}1.90                                         & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}1.08                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}0.79                                          \\ \midrule
    I thought the system was easy to use.                                                      & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}3.44                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}4.07                                         & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}0.93                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}0.73                                          \\ \midrule
    I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system. & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}2.94                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}2.20                                         & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}1.22                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}1.14                                          \\ \midrule
    I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.                         & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}3.00                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}4.30                                         & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}0.94                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}0.64                                          \\ \midrule
    I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.                                 & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}2.44                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}1.33                                         & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}1.20                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}0.54                                          \\ \midrule
    I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.              & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}3.63                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}4.13                                         & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}1.02                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}0.85                                          \\ \midrule
    I found the system very cumbersome to use.                                                 & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}2.34                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}1.33                                         & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}1.08                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}0.54                                          \\ \midrule
    I felt very confident using the system.                                                    & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}3.25                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}4.00                                         & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}1.20                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}0.93                                          \\ \midrule
    I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.               & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}2.81                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}2.43                                         & \cellcolor[HTML]{EFEFEF}1.13                                            & \cellcolor[HTML]{E6E6E6}1.12                                          \\ \bottomrule
