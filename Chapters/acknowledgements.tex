I would like to thank \textit{Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa} and in special to the \textit{Departamento de Informática} for providing me an excelent knowledge base and for setting me challenges that would make me overcome myself, day after day.

Secondly, I have to thank my advisers Tiago Simões, Teresa Romão, and Rui Nóbrega for mentoring me throughout this dissertation. Your support was essential and I learned a lot from you!

Thank you to OutSystems for taking initiative on this interesting research project. And also to all the people I met in the office and in the online meetings, due to this new normal. Everyone was ready to help and the environment was amazing. Also, thank you to all participants of the usability tests.

Furthermore, a huge thank to my friend and partner of this journey Pedro Deodato. We met each other in the first year of university and then we have been walking this journey as a team - P\&PCl forever. Thank you for sharing with me the greatest achievements and all the moments we had to overcome during these five years. We will never forget the sleepless nights working on our projects, but the most important is that we did it!

Last but not least, I would also like to express that I'm thankful for all the support my family has given to me. In particular, I would like to thank, my parents, and my siblings. They always encouraged me and supported me whenever I needed it. Without your support, it would have been impossible to get this far. Also, a big thank you to my grandparents, you are an inspiration to me.

Finally, a special thanks to Mariana, who always has been here for everything. This accomplishment would not have been possible without you.
