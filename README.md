# Accelerating SQL with Complex Visual Querying

This is a repository of a **Master Thesis**. This Project was developed by **Pedro Santos Rodrigues** in order to obtain the Master Degree of **Computer Science and Informatics Engineering at NOVA School of Science and Technology (FCT NOVA)**. Although the work has much academical content, it has also some business content, once all this project was developed on **OutSystems** in order to increment the value of the company and its product.

## Project Context

OutSystems is a multi-awarded company that offers a groundbreaking solution for rapid application development (RAD) with the OutSystems Platform, empowering developers to build innovative business solutions fast with low effort. Using a **visual programming language**, the OutSystems platform allows developers to create state-of-the-art web and mobile applications, while having little concern for the complex technologies that implement those applications. OutSystems automatically generates all the code that is needed to run the applications. The platform provides a visual querying language that enables users with little or no development knowledge to get data from the database and transform it by joining, filterering, sorting, or grouping it. All this without the need to resort to SQL or any other complex querying language.

## Project Description

Although this language covers a majority of usages, there are scenarios where it may not be powerful or usable enough. This is especially true when dealing with several database tables or when needing more advanced constructs like subqueries, IN, NOT IN, NOT EXISTS clauses, and more. In those cases OutSystems developers need to resort to low-level SQL code, which not only requires more skills, but also makes the code harder to read, increasing the cost of evolving the applications with fixes or new features. The goal of this project is to design and evaluate a new and more powerful Language and **User Experience** that allows developers to do all these complex data queries in a very easy way without using SQL.
