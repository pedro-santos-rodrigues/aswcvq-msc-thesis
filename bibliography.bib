abstract="The significance of usability as one of the most important system characteristics is widely recognized in all the application fields, including databases. This also implies the involvement of the user in the activities of design and testing of any interface. However, very few studies aiming at validating the usability of a system have been proposed in the database field, in contrast to many other computer science areas. In this paper we present an experiment comparing, from the point of view of the ease-of-use, a novel visual query language, namely QBD*, against a well-known traditional textual language such as SQL. The results of the experiment confirmed the superiority of the QBD* approach, which is based on a conceptual data model, closer to the user view of the reality than the relational model, a visual representation of such a model, more attractive and graspable than a textual list of table names, and direct manipulation commands, having a syntax much more easier than the SQL one.",

The methodology is an adaptation of the design walkthrough techniques that have been used for many years in the software engineering community. Traditional walkthroughs involve hand simulation of sections of code to ensure that they implement specified functionality. The method we present involves hand simulation of the cognitive activities of a user, to ensure that the user can easily learn to perform tasks that the system is intended to support. The cognitive walkthrough methodology, described in detail, is based on a theory of learning by exploration presented in this paper. There is a summary of preliminary results of effectiveness and comparisons with other design methods."

abstract = "This research reports on the experimental test of several causes of user errors while composing database queries. The query language under consideration is Structured Query Language (SQL), the industry standard language for querying databases. Unfortunately, users commit many errors when using SQL. To understand user errors, a model of query writing was developed that integrated a GOMS-type analysis of query writing with the characteristics of human cognition. This model revealed multiple cognitive causes of a frequent and troublesome error, join clause omission. This semantic user error returns answers from the database that may be undetectably wrong, affecting users, decision makers, and programmers. The model predicted four possible causes of join clause omission, and empirical testing revealed that all four contributed to the error. Specifically, the frequency of this error increased because (1) the load on working memory caused by writing intervening clauses made the users forget to include the join clause, (2) an explicit clue to write the join clause was absent from the problem statement, (3) users inappropriately reused the procedure appropriate for a single table query, which requires no join clause, when a join clause is indeed necessary, and (4) some users never learned the correct procedure. These results are significant for understanding user errors in general and for developing new interfaces and training schemes for the task of writing database queries."

abstract = {Abstract End-user computing has become a well-established aspect of enterprise database systems today. End-user computing performance depends on the user–database interface, in which the data model and query language are major components. We examined three prominent data models—the relational model, the Extended-Entity-Relationship (EER) model, and the Object-Oriented (OO) model—and their query languages in a rigorous and systematic experiment to evaluate their effects on novice end-user computing performance in the context of database design and data manipulation. In addition, relationships among the performances for different tasks (modeling, query writing, query comprehension) were postulated with the use of a cognitive model for the query process, and are tested in the experiment. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques were used to examine the multiple causal relationships simultaneously. The findings indicate that the EER and OO models overwhelmingly outperformed the relational model in terms of accuracy for both database design and data manipulation. The associations between tasks suggest that data modeling techniques would enhance query writing correctness, and query writing ability would contribute to query comprehension. This study provides a better and thorough understanding of the inter-relationships among these data modeling and task factors. Our findings have significant implications for novice end-user training and development.},
